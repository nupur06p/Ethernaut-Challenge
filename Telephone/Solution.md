In this challenge, we have the below complexity to beat the level:

"Claim ownership of the contract below to complete this level."

We can change the owner of the contract at two places, the constructor and the `changeOwner` function. Since we cannot make modifications in the constructor, we need to utilize the `changeOwner` function.

The `changeOwner` function checks whether `tx.origin`, is not equal to `msg.sender`. Inorder to exploit this contract, we need to know the difference between `tx.origin` and `msg.sender`: `tx.origin`identifies the original sender of a transaction. It points to the external account initiating the transaction and remains constant throughout subsequent smart contract interactions, while `msg.sender` refers to the the sender of the current call. When a transaction moves through several smart contracts, the `msg.sender` value changes to indicate the most recent contract address in the call chain.

When EOA calls `Telephone` contract, both `msg.sender` and `tx.origin` remains the same. 

We create a `TelephoneAttack` contract to exploit the vulnerability. The `TelephoneAttack` contract has an instance of the `Telephone` contract and when the `TelephoneAttack` contract calls the `Telephone` contract the `tx.origin` and `msg.sender` are not the same. The `teleAttack` function in the `TelephoneAttack` contract tricks the owner of the `Telephone` contract. Because `Telephone` contract `changeOwner` function checks `tx.origin` and not `msg.sender`, it will see the original transaction initiator (the unsuspecting user) as the sender, and not this contract, thereby changing the ownership to this attacker contract. Hence, we are able to change the owner and claim the ownership of the contract. 

Note: Itâ€™s important to note that relying on `tx.origin` for authentication purposes is discouraged because it can make contracts vulnerable to phishing attacks. This is because the `tx.origin` does not change during the entire transaction execution, regardless of how many contracts call each other. Therefore, if an attacker was able to get a user to call a malicious contract, the attacker could authenticate as tx.origin on the authenticating contract. For this reason, it is better to use `msg.sender` for authentication purposes to help ensure the immediate caller is the address that is undergoing authentication.

## Steps for the above challenge
1. Create a `TelephoneAttack` contract which calls the `Telephone` contract.
2. The `changeOwner` function is called in the `TelephoneAttack` contract.
3. Ownership is claimed.
