# Fallout

In the Fallout challenge, we hae the below complexity to beat the level:

### Claim ownership of the contract below to complete this level.

Here, we can find function `Fal1out()` marked as `constructor`. Prior to 0.4.22, constructors were named as functions and they carried the same name as the contract.

However, here due to misspelling the `constructor` is named as `Fal1out()` instead of `Fallout()`. Hence, it is not a constructor. The function `Fal1out()` is an public one. Hence, if we call the function `Fal1out()`, the ownership of the contract can be claimed.

## Steps for the above challenge
1. Call function `Fal1out()`
2. Ownership of the contract is claimed
