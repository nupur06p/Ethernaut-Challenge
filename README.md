# Ethernaut Challenge Solutions

OpenZeppelin provides us the CTF EThernaut and we need to provide solutions to the wargame. The Ethernaut is a Web3/Solidity based wargame inspired by overthewire.org, played in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. 

Each level is a smart contract that needs to be 'hacked'. 

Below are the levels which we would be discussing-
